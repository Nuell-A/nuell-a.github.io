        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! my name is Emanuel and I enjoy coding. It all started my sophmore year in college 
            when I took a computer science intro course. Ever since then I've been pursuing knowledge
            in software and how to create it. Even when I joined the Air Force that didn't stop me from
            picking up more classes to continue my learning process.
        </p>
        <p>
            I separated from the Air Force in December 2022 and now I will finish my bachelor's in computer 
            science by (estimated) December 2024. While I was active duty I managed to gain lots of experience
            in problem solving working as an avionics technician. I also managed to obtain multiple CompTIA
            certifications.
